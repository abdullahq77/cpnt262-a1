# cpnt262-a1 Codepen init()
By Abdullah

## Struggles/obstacles and notes
A lot of CodePens used scss instead of css, so had to be careful with that. Finding a codepen that didn't use too much of either 
html, css or js was difficult because even though there are a lot of amazing choices, they can be very complicated. Other then that the assignment seemed pretty straightforward.
